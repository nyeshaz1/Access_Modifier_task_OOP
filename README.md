Mobile Class â€“ OOP Practice in C++
This project is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts. The main focus of this task is to understand how access modifiers work in classes and how to create and use objects in C++.

What this program covers

Use of access modifier: public
Creating a class
Defining attributes like IMEI number, type, make, model number, memory, and operating system
Writing member functions to set and display values
Taking input using both cin and getline
Using cin.ignore to manage mixed input types (numbers and strings)
Creating and using an object of the class in main function

Program Description

A class named Mobile is created. It contains the following data members
IMEIno (integer)
type (string)
make (string)
Modelno (integer)
memory (float)
os (string)
Two functions are included
setvalues: Takes input from the user
displayvalues: Displays the data entered

How to Run

Save the file with the name main.cpp
Open terminal or any C++ IDE
Compile the code using a C++ compiler like g++
Run the compiled file to see the output

Sample Output

Enter the IMEI no : 123456789
Enter Type : Smartphone
Enter make : Samsung
Enter the Model no : 14
Enter the memory : 128
Enter the Operating System : Android 13

The IMEI no : 123456789
The Type : Smartphone
The make : Samsung
The Model no : 14
The memory : 128
The Operating System : Android 13

Use Case

This task is useful for beginners who are learning C++ and Object-Oriented Programming. It helps in understanding how to structure a class, use access modifiers, take mixed input, and implement basic input/output handling with class objects.
